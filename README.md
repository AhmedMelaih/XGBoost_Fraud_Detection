XGBoost Fraud Detection
This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an XGBoost-based fraud detection pipeline.

Contents
XGBoost_Fraud_Detection_For_GitHub.ipynb — cleaned notebook with explanatory markdown cells added before each code cell.
requirements.txt — inferred Python packages used by the notebook.
How to run
Create a Python environment (recommended Python 3.9+).
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your dataset(s) in the repository root or update the paths in the notebook.
Open the notebook with Jupyter Lab/Notebook or upload to Google Colab and run cells to reproduce results.
Notes & recommendations
Outputs have been cleared to keep the file size small for GitHub. Run the notebook locally to regenerate outputs and plots.
Pin package versions in requirements.txt if you want exact reproducibility.
If the dataset is sensitive or large, provide a small synthetic/sample CSV and add instructions for obtaining the real data.
Consider adding a .gitignore listing data files and large model artifacts.
If you'd like, I can:

Pin exact package versions (I can try to infer from the environment or you can provide your working pip freeze).
Create a small sample dataset and add a demo run.
Prepare a GitHub Actions workflow to run basic checks on the notebook.
